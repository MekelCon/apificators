<h2>What is SPAMBEE</h2>
<p>SPAMBEE is a tool that allows you to easily handle suspicious emails and notify them to experts who will make a complete diagnosis of each transmitted email. Once processed, these emails will feed a database of senders to ban. This "bocklist" will be shared with all SPAMBEE users. In this way the anti-spam filter will be enhanced thanks to the participation of each user.</p>

<h2>Why using SPAMBEE</h2>
<p>Because we will be able to fight against phishing more efficiently if we fight all together. One bee alone can't do anything, a swarm of bees is powerfull.</p>
